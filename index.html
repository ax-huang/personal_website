    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Andrew</strong>. I <em>was</em> in the CST program before I decided to take a break and now I am here in CIT. I
        have little to no computer knowledge other than the basics. I can't wait to learn more in CIT. My hobbies
        include listening to music, watching Korean dramas, and playing video games.
